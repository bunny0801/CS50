Introduction to programming:

Implement in Scratch any project of your choice, be it an interactive story, game, animation, or anything else, subject only to the following requirements:

Your project must have at least two sprites, at least one of which must resemble something other than a cat.
Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
Your project must use at least one condition, one loop, and one variable.
Your project must use at least one sound.

My scratch project is a 2D shooter where you use your keyboard to move a character around and use your mouse to point and shoot. In this game you take control of a cat and
duel with an invading spaceship.
